# BestBooks Accounting Application Framework - AUDITOR

Using the R-language and examples from https://github.com/ameypophali/Auditing-financial-data-using-R.git repository, BestBooks Auditor will provide automatic financial audits with a notation added to the financial report using the noteToFinancialStatement component of bestbooks-reports.

## Financial Statement Notes

An entry to the financial statements by bestbooks-auditor would be considered a management entry since the BestBooks Auditor is NOT a registered CPA or licensed Auditor.
