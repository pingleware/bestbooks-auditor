# BestBooks Accounting Application Framework - AUDITOR

Using the R-language and examples from https://github.com/ameypophali/Auditing-financial-data-using-R.git repository, BestBooks Auditor will provide automatic financial audits with a notation added to the financial report using the noteToFinancialStatement component of bestbooks-reports.

## Introduction to R

See https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf

## Installing R

R language is required and can be installed from https://www.r-project.org/. The Rscript tool is used to launch R scripts from the command line, and is included in the R installation package.

## Financial Statement Notes

An entry to the financial statements by bestbooks-auditor would be considered a management entry since the BestBooks Auditor is NOT a registered CPA or licensed Auditor.

## Internal Controls

An important factor of audits is to access the risk of internal controls. When revenue was received by the USPS, there were four employees to process, record and deposit the checks received. In today's economy where electronic payments are the norm, a paper trail is already established and routing payments to operating accountin is usually automatic.
